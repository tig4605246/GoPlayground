    Update:

        [x]testing package: assert package
            test function made with assert package

        [x]multiple output with map
            Now it'll output all errors with map[string]string

        [x]recursive struct , Can it solve it?

        [x]Can struct detect if a value is empty or not
            It recognize empty value as true

        [x]Empty must be concerned

    To-do:

        Accept array as input for validation
